# OiEvents

Preface:
The events industry produces 600,000 tons of waste every year, excluding food wastes. What if there is a marketplace for event organizers to rent used event materials (bamboo, aluminium, decorative pieces, artworks, etc.) to stop waste production? Oi Events is positioned to be at that frontier and help to aliviate the landfill crisis. 

To best serve this cause, transparency of C02 emissions by transports around the world must be known and logistics costs must also be known to optimize over time. To minimize both of these costs, the rules of storage must be applied. A Mixed-Integer Programming model is used to compute the steps needed to satisfy all event demands simulated as cities around the world, meaning steps to delivery how much content and to where. Today, MIP is used commercially to optimize scheduling for production, goods transfers and many other business and governmental purposes, mainly for more efficient allocation of resources.
